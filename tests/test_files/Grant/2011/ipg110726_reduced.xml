<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present application relates to measurement devices, and more particularly, to articulated arm coordinate measuring.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Rectilinear measuring systems, also referred to as coordinate measuring machines (PCMM's) and articulated arm measuring machines, are used to generate geometry information. In general, these instruments capture the structural characteristics of an object for use in quality control, electronic rendering and/or duplication. One example of a conventional apparatus used for coordinate data acquisition is a portable coordinate measuring machine (PCMM), which is a portable device capable of taking highly accurate measurements within a measuring sphere of the device. Such devices often include a probe mounted on an end of an arm that includes a plurality of transfer members connected together by joints. The end of the arm opposite the probe is typically coupled to a moveable base. Typically, the joints are broken down into singular rotational degrees of freedom, each of which is measured using a dedicated rotational transducer. During a measurement, the probe of the arm is moved manually by an operator to various points in the measurement sphere. At each point, the position of each of the joints must be determined at a given instant in time. Accordingly, each transducer outputs an electrical signal that varies according to the movement of the joint in that degree of freedom. Typically, the probe also generates a signal. These position signals and the probe signal are transferred through the arm to a recorder/analyzer. The position signals are then used to determine the position of the probe within the measurement sphere. See e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,829,148 and 7,174,651.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Typically, when PCMMs are used, an operator positions his hands at various locations along the arms and joints of the PCMM to move the probe into a desired position for data acquisition. During the course of a measurement session, an operator may move his hands significantly to position and reposition the PCMM. Additionally, different operators may position their hands at different locations along the PCMM. Accordingly, it can be difficult to initially calibrate a PCMM to account for the various loads applied by different operators at different locations along the PCMM.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">As mentioned above, the purpose of PCMM's is to take highly accurate measurements. Accordingly, there is a continuing need to improve the accuracy of such devices.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates one embodiment of a coordinate measuring machine (PCMM) <b>10</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the PCMM <b>10</b> comprises a base <b>20</b>, a plurality of substantially rigid, transfer members <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>, and <b>28</b>, a coordinate acquisition member <b>30</b>, and a plurality of articulation members <b>40</b>, <b>42</b>, <b>44</b>, <b>46</b>, <b>48</b>, <b>50</b> connecting the rigid transfer members <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> to one another. Each articulation member is configured to impart one or more rotational and/or angular degrees of freedom. The articulation members <b>40</b>, <b>42</b>, <b>44</b>, <b>46</b>, <b>48</b>, and <b>50</b> allow the transfer members <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> of the PCMM <b>10</b> to be aligned in various spatial orientations thereby <b>38</b> allowing fine positioning of a coordinate acquisition member <b>30</b> in three-dimensional space.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The position of the rigid transfer members <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> and the coordinate acquisition member <b>30</b> may be adjusted manually, or using, robotic, semi-robotic, and/or any other adjustment method. In one embodiment, the PCMM <b>10</b>, through the various articulation members <b>40</b>, <b>42</b>, <b>44</b>, <b>46</b>, <b>48</b>, <b>50</b>, is provided with six rotary axes of movement. However, there is no strict limitation to the number or order of axes of movement that may be used, and, in other embodiments, a PCMM can have more or fewer axes of movement.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In the embodiment of PCMM <b>10</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the articulation members <b>40</b>, <b>42</b>, <b>44</b>, <b>46</b>, <b>48</b>, <b>50</b> can be divided into two functional groupings based on their operation, namely: 1) those articulation members <b>40</b>, <b>44</b>, and <b>48</b> which allow the swiveling motion associated with a specific transfer member (hereinafter, &#x201c;swiveling joints&#x201d;), and 2) those articulation members <b>42</b>, <b>46</b>, and <b>50</b> which allow a change in the relative angle formed between two adjacent members or between the coordinate acquisition member <b>30</b> and its adjacent member (hereinafter, &#x201c;hinge joints&#x201d;). While the illustrated embodiment includes three swiveling joints and three hinge joints positioned as to create six axes of movement, it is contemplated that in other embodiments, the number of and location of hinge joints and swiveling joints can be varied to achieve different movement characteristics in a PCMM. For example, a substantially similar device with seven axes of movement could simply have an additional swivel joint between the coordinate acquisition member <b>30</b> and articulation member <b>50</b>. In still other embodiments, the swiveling joints and hinge joints can be combined and/or used in different combinations.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The coordinate acquisition member <b>30</b> can comprise a contact sensitive member or hard probe <b>32</b> configured to engage surfaces of a selected object and/or generate coordinate data on the basis of probe contact as is known in the art. Alternatively, the coordinate acquisition member <b>30</b> can comprise a remote scanning and detection component that does not necessarily require direct contact with the selected object to acquire geometry data. In one embodiment, a laser coordinate detection device (e.g., laser camera) can be used to obtain geometry data without direct object contact. It will be appreciated that in various embodiments of PCMM, various coordinate acquisition member <b>30</b> configurations can be used including: a contact-sensitive probe, a remote-scanning probe, a laser-scanning probe, a probe that uses a strain gauge for contact detection, a probe that uses a pressure sensor for contact detection, a probe that used an infrared beam for positioning, and a probe configured to be electrostatically-responsive can be used for the purposes of coordinate acquisition.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in various embodiments of the PCMM <b>10</b>, the various devices which may be used for coordinate acquisition, such as the probe <b>32</b>, may be configured to be manually disconnected and reconnected from the PCMM <b>10</b> such that an operator can change coordinate acquisition devices without specialized tools. Thus, an operator can quickly and easily remove one coordinate acquisition device and replace it with another coordinate acquisition device. Such a connection may comprise any quick disconnect or manual disconnect device. This rapid connection capability of a coordinate acquisition device can be particularly advantageous in a PCMM <b>10</b> that can be used for a wide variety of measuring techniques (e.g. measurements requiring physical contact of the coordinate acquisition member with a surface followed by measurements requiring only optical contact of the coordinate acquisition member) in a relatively short period of time.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the coordinate acquisition member <b>30</b> also comprises buttons <b>66</b>, which are configured to be accessible by an operator. By pressing one or more of the buttons <b>66</b> singly, multiply, or in a preset sequence, the operator can input various commands to the PCMM <b>10</b>. In some embodiments the buttons <b>66</b> can be used to indicate that a coordinate reading is ready to be recorded. In other embodiments the buttons <b>66</b> can be used to indicate that the location being measured is a home position and that other positions should be measured relative to the home position. In other embodiments the buttons may be used to turn on or off the PCMM <b>10</b>. In other embodiments, the buttons <b>66</b> can be programmable to meet an operator's specific needs. The location of the buttons <b>66</b> on the coordinate acquisition member <b>30</b> can be advantageous in that an operator need not access the base <b>20</b> or a computer in order to activate various functions of the PCMM <b>10</b> while using the coordinate acquisition member <b>30</b>. This positioning may be particularly advantageous in embodiments of PCMM having transfer members <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>, or <b>28</b> that are particularly long, thus placing the base <b>20</b> out of reach for an operator of the coordinate acquisition member <b>30</b>. In some embodiments of the PCMM <b>10</b>, any number of operator input buttons (e.g., more or fewer than the three illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), can be provided, which may be placed in various other positions on the coordinate acquisition member <b>30</b> or anywhere on the PCMM <b>10</b>. Other embodiments of PCMM can include other operator input devices positioned on the PCMM or the coordinate acquisition member <b>30</b>, such as switches, rotary dials, or touch pads in place of, or in addition to operator input buttons.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in some embodiments, the base <b>20</b> further comprises magnetic attachment mounts <b>60</b> that can attach the base <b>20</b> to a metallic work surface.

<p id="p-0028" num="0027">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in some embodiments, the base <b>20</b> of the PCMM <b>10</b> can also include a self contained power source <b>64</b> such as a battery.

<p id="p-0029" num="0028">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the transfer members <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>, and <b>28</b> are preferably constructed of hollow generally cylindrical tubular members so as to provide substantial rigidity to the members <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>, and <b>28</b>. The transfer members <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>, and <b>28</b> can be made of any suitable material which will provide a substantially rigid extension for the PCMM <b>10</b>. As will be discussed in greater detail below, the transfer members <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>, and <b>28</b> preferably define a double tube assembly so as to provide additional rigidity to the transfer members <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>, and <b>28</b>. Furthermore, it is contemplated that the transfer members <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>, and <b>28</b> in various other embodiments can be made of alternate shapes such as those comprising a triangular or octagonal cross-section.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In some embodiments, it can be desirable to use a composite material, such as a carbon fiber material, to construct at least a portion of the transfer members <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>, and <b>28</b>. In some embodiments, other components of the PCMM <b>10</b> can also comprise composite materials such as carbon fiber materials. Constructing the transfer members <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> of composite such as carbon fiber can be particularly advantageous in that the carbon fiber can react less to thermal influences as compared to metallic materials such as steel or aluminum. Thus, coordinate measuring can be accurately and consistently performed at various temperatures. In other embodiments, the transfer members <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> can comprise metallic materials, or can comprise combinations of materials such as metallic materials, ceramics, thermoplastics, or composite materials. Also, as will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, many of the other components of the PCMM <b>10</b> can also be made of composites such as carbon fiber. Presently, as the manufacturing capabilities for composites are generally not as precise when compared to manufacturing capabilities for metals, generally the components of the PCMM <b>10</b> that require a greater degree of dimensional precision are generally made of a metals such as aluminum. It is foreseeable that as the manufacturing capabilities of composites improved that a greater number of components of the PCMM <b>10</b> can be also made of composites.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, some embodiments of the PCMM <b>10</b> may also comprise a counterbalance system <b>80</b> that can assist an operator by mitigating the effects of the weight of the transfer members <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> and the articulating members <b>44</b>, <b>46</b>, <b>48</b>, and <b>50</b>. In some orientations, when the transfer members <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> are extended away from the base <b>20</b>, the weight of the transfer members <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> can create difficulties for an operator. Thus, a counterbalance system <b>80</b> can be particularly advantageous to reduce the amount of effort that an operator needs to position the PCMM for convenient measuring. In some embodiments, the counterbalance system <b>80</b> can comprise resistance units (not shown) which are configured to ease the motion of the transfer members <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> without the need for heavy weights to cantilever the transfer members <b>26</b> and <b>28</b>. It will be appreciated by one skilled in the art that in other embodiments simple cantilevered counterweights can be used in place or in combination with resistance units.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the resistance units are attached to the transfer member <b>26</b> to provide assisting resistance for motion of the transfer members <b>26</b> and <b>28</b>. In some embodiments, the resistance units can comprise hydraulic resistance units which use fluid resistance to provide assistance for motion of the transfer members <b>26</b> and <b>28</b>. In other embodiments the resistance units may comprise other resistance devices such as pneumatic resistance devices, or linear or rotary spring systems.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the position of the probe <b>32</b> in space at a given instant can be calculated if the length of each transfer member <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>, and <b>28</b> and the specific position of each of the articulation members <b>40</b>, <b>42</b>, <b>44</b>, <b>46</b>, <b>48</b>, and <b>50</b> are known. The position of each of the articulation members <b>40</b>, <b>42</b>, <b>44</b>, <b>46</b>, <b>48</b>, and <b>50</b> can be measured as a singular rotational degree of motion using a dedicated rotational transducer, which will be described in more detail below. Each transducer can output a signal (e.g., an electrical signal), which can vary according to the movement of the <b>40</b>, <b>42</b>, <b>44</b>, <b>46</b>, <b>48</b>, <b>50</b> in its degree of motion. The signal can be carried through wires or otherwise transmitted to the base <b>20</b> of the PCMM <b>10</b>. From there, the signal can be processed and/or transferred to a computer for determining the position of the probe <b>32</b> in space.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In some embodiments of PCMM <b>10</b>, a rotational transducer for each of the articulation members <b>40</b>, <b>42</b>, <b>44</b>, <b>46</b>, <b>48</b>, and <b>50</b> can comprise an optical encoder. Various embodiments of optical encoder are discussed in more detail below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-6</figref>. In general, an optical encoder measures the rotational position of an axle by coupling is movement to a pair of internal hubs having successive transparent and opaque bands. In such embodiments, light can be shined through or reflected from the hubs onto optical sensors which feed a pair of electrical outputs. As the axle sweeps through an arc, the output of an analog optical encoder can be substantially two sinusoidal signals which are 90 degrees out of phase. Coarse positioning can be determined through monitoring a change in polarity of the two signals. Fine positioning can be determined by measuring an actual value of the two signals at a specific time. In certain embodiments, enhanced accuracy can be obtained by measuring the output precisely before it is corrupted by electronic noise. Thus, digitizing the position information before it is sent to the processor or computer can lead to enhanced measurement accuracy.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As will be described in detail below, in the illustrated embodiment, the articulation members <b>40</b>, <b>42</b>, <b>44</b>, <b>46</b>, <b>48</b>., and <b>50</b> can be divided into two general categories, namely: 1) articulation members <b>40</b>, <b>44</b>, <b>48</b>, which allow swiveling motion of a transfer member <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> and are thus sometimes referred to as &#x201c;swivel members&#x201d; <b>40</b>, <b>44</b>, <b>48</b> herein and 2) articulation members <b>42</b>, <b>46</b> and <b>50</b>, which allow for change in the relative angle formed between two adjacent members and are sometimes referred to herein as &#x201c;pivot or hinge members&#x201d; <b>42</b>, <b>46</b>, <b>50</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0037" num="0036">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b>A, and <b>2</b>B, in some embodiments, the PCMM <b>10</b> can comprise one or more rotatable grip assemblies <b>100</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the PCMM <b>10</b> can comprise a lower rotatable grip assembly <b>102</b> and an upper rotatable grip assembly <b>104</b>. Advantageously, having a lower rotatable grip assembly <b>102</b> and an upper rotatable grip assembly <b>104</b> disposed on the transfer member <b>28</b>, allows the operator to easily use both hands in positioning the PCMM <b>10</b>. In other embodiments, the PCMM <b>10</b> can comprise one, or more than two rotatable grips.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Certain desirable characteristics of a manually operated articulated arm PCMM are that the PCMM is easy to articulate by an operator and accurate in its measurement. One advantage of a rotatable grip assembly <b>100</b> as described herein is that it can make the PCMM easier for an operator to articulate. The rotatable grip assembly <b>100</b> rolls through the operator's hands with the grip relieving the majority of the friction that would normally exist between the operator's hand and the transfer member of the PCMM.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Another advantage of the easy, ergonomic, and low friction operation of the rotatable grip assembly <b>100</b> is a more accurate PCMM. When an operator positions a hand on the transfer member of the PCMM, variability of fictional forces between the operator and the PCMM can be a source of error in the accuracy of a PCMM's measurement. When an operator's hand is not on a rotatable grip assembly <b>100</b>, fictional forces between the operator's hand and the transfer member of the PCMM can change as the operator articulates the arm into different positions. Further these forces can vary as the operator stiffens or loosens his grip on the arm. These forces also vary from one operator to another.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Some previous PCMMs have had overdesigned joint assemblies to compensate for the variability in fictional forces and the variability and in positions in which an operator may grasp the PCMM. These joint assemblies resulted in a PCMM that was relatively heavy and costly. Other PCMMs have included costly strain sensors or additional encoder read heads in order to compensate for operator forces. Advantageously, a PCMM with one or more rotatable grip assemblies <b>100</b> can reduce operator forces on the PCMM in a cost-efficient manner.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Desirably, the rotatable grip assemblies <b>100</b> can rotate freely and infinitely about a portion of the PCMM <b>10</b>. This free and infinite rotation allows an operator to easily grasp the rotatable grips <b>100</b> and position the PCMM <b>10</b> as desired. In other embodiments the rotatable grips <b>100</b> can rotate through a predetermined range defined by rotational stops.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>, an operator may grasp the PCMM <b>10</b> using the grip assemblies <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>. As the operator moves the PCMM <b>10</b> from a first position (illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>) to a second position (illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>), the grip assemblies <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> can rotate to accommodate this motion. Thus, advantageously, an operator need not reposition one or both of his hands as he repositions the PCMM <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Another advantage of the rotatable grips <b>100</b> is increased accuracy of the measurements obtained. Previously, operators would position their hands at any convenient location along the transfer member <b>28</b>. Accordingly, the PCMM <b>10</b> could experience slightly different operator-induced load conditions depending on the position of the operator's hands. While the PCMM <b>10</b> can be calibrated to account for the position of an operator's hands at an expected location, previously, there would be no indication that an operator would place his hands at this expected location. However, the rotatable grips <b>100</b> provide prescribed locations upon which an operator is to position his hands. Thus, advantageously, the PCMM <b>10</b> can be calibrated with a known position of the operator's hands on the PCMM <b>10</b>. Accordingly, variations in PCMM accuracy due to variations in positioning of individual operators' hands can be minimized.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Furthermore, the rotatable grips <b>100</b> can be positioned on the PCMM <b>10</b> at a location where relatively little force is required to position the PCMM <b>10</b>. Accordingly, a PCMM <b>10</b> having rotatable grips <b>100</b> so positioned would have enhanced durability and reliability as it would likely encounter lower loading during routine use than a PCMM without rotatable grips <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b>A, and <b>2</b>B, in the illustrated embodiment, the rotatable grip assemblies <b>100</b> can be disposed on the transfer member <b>28</b> furthest away from the base <b>20</b>. Desirably, operators typically position the PCMM <b>10</b> using this transfer member <b>28</b>. Operators typically position one hand adjacent the probe and another either along the transfer member <b>28</b> or at an end of the transfer member <b>28</b> opposite the probe, as illustrated in phantom lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>. In the illustrated embodiment, the PCMM <b>10</b> includes two rotatable grips assemblies <b>100</b>, one at each typical operator grasping location. In other embodiments, rotatable grip assemblies <b>100</b> can be disposed on other transfer members <b>26</b>, <b>24</b> in addition to or instead of the rotatable grips <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> on transfer member <b>28</b> furthest away from the base <b>20</b>.</p>

Desirably, the rotatable sleeve <b>110</b> can rotate freely with respect to an outer surface of the transfer member <b>28</b> and surfaces of the upper retaining ring <b>114</b> and the lower retaining ring <b>116</b>. The rotatable sleeve <b>110</b> can have a generally cylindrical body with flanged lips at a first end and a second end thereof. The flanged lips on the rotatable sleeve <b>110</b> can retain the grip portion <b>112</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims benefit of Provisional Appln. 61/021,624, filed Jan. 16, 2008, the entire contents of which is hereby incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein, under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;119(e).</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to fitting golf clubs to players. The disclosure relates more specifically to apparatus that can measure parameters of a golf club.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The approaches described in this section are approaches that could be pursued, but not necessarily approaches that have been previously conceived or pursued. Therefore, unless otherwise indicated, it should not be assumed that any of the approaches described in this section qualify as prior art merely by virtue of their inclusion in this section.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A golfer can achieve better performance on the course when the golfer's clubs are well fitted to the height and stance of the golfer. However, current approaches for fitting golf clubs to players are crude. Players can buy pre-manufactured sets of golf clubs in which one club size is intended to fit all golfers. Alternatively, a player can opt for custom fitting.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">One present approach for custom golf club fitting typically involves a player repeatedly gripping and test-swinging multiple different sample clubs until the player identifies a sample club that appears to fit. A drawback of this approach is that the seller of the golf clubs must maintain an inventory of sample clubs in a large range of sizes. The approach is also impractical for most retailers because a large amount of storage space is needed to store an inventory of clubs for custom fitting. When the approach is multiplied across many different golf club product lines, the number of clubs required for accurate fitting is too numerous and the cost is too large for a large number of retail locations to implement it.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The approach is also tedious for the golfer, who must repeatedly grip, try, and evaluate many different clubs having different parameters such as shaft length, head lie angle, shaft flexibility, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Golf club vendors typically address some of these issues by holding periodic club fitting events. For example, a truck carrying the inventory of clubs visits a country club, golf store or other retail outlet for a short period of time. However, for the golfer this approach is inconvenient because the golfer may not learn about the fitting event until too late.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Further using the foregoing approach to accurately fit a golfer may require the golf club vendor to make up dozens of clubs that fit only a small percentage of golfers, thus wasting manufacturing resources.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">U.S. Pat. No. 5,469,627 shows a golf club fitting apparatus that uses electrical contacts and sensors to detect the length and angle at which a golf club has held. However, the use of electrical contacts as described in the '627 patent is believed to provide inaccurate measurements. Further, the '627 patent uses a single fixed fitting club head <b>14</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). If a golfer prefers to use a golf club head of a different type (such as a two-ball putter head rather than a blade putter head), the golfer cannot accurately visualize how a custom-made club with that golfer's preferred head will actually look and feel.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF DISCLOSURE</heading>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In the following description, for the purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It will be apparent, however, that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">1.0 Golf Club Fitting System</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> is a block diagram of a golf club fitting system. A golf club retailer <b>10</b> has a kiosk <b>20</b> and a network access point <b>26</b>. Golf club retailer comprises any location that can offer golf clubs for sale, including a retail store, pro shop, truck, trailer, shopping mall kiosk location, etc. In an embodiment, kiosk <b>20</b> comprises a golf club fitting apparatus <b>12</b>, computer <b>14</b>, and display <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Golf club fitting apparatus <b>12</b> comprises a movable golf club arm coupled to a plurality of encoders in a mechanical arrangement that is further described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-9</figref> inclusive, and which is not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> for clarity. Generally, a customer grasps the arm of apparatus <b>12</b> and stands in a comfortable swing address position or playing position. A linear encoder of the apparatus <b>12</b> detects a length of a golf club that a customer prefers and an angular encoder detects a lie angle of a golf club head, based on the customer's stance in the swing address position.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Golf club fitting apparatus <b>12</b> comprises a display <b>15</b> and an encoder interface <b>13</b> that can provide data representing positions of the encoders to computer <b>14</b>. In an embodiment, computer <b>14</b> is coupled to display <b>22</b> and to display <b>15</b>. For example, dual video cards may be used in computer <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">As further described herein, in an embodiment, the display <b>15</b> of the apparatus <b>12</b> displays a three-dimensional graphical image of a golf club head in a position that simulates the appearance of an actual golf club head when a player holds the apparatus <b>12</b> in a swing address position. As the customer moves an arm of the apparatus <b>12</b> linearly or angularly, software in computer <b>14</b> re-displays the golf club head image in a changed position that matches movement of the customer. Therefore, the customer can see a view of a virtual golf club head in display <b>15</b> that changes in real time as the customer's stance changes. The image in display <b>15</b> may also include a virtual golf ball, putting green, fairway surface, or other visual information.</p>

<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Using the arrangement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, a retailer can offer custom fitting of golf clubs without maintaining an inventory of clubs by providing the apparatus <b>12</b> for measuring player attributes and then delivering the attributes to an offsite manufacturer. The customer later returns to the retail location to pick up the custom made club. Using just-in-time manufacturing techniques and overnight courier shipping the time from custom fitting to delivery of a club can be as short as two days. The retailer is not required to maintain a large inventory of clubs, and the customer is not required to repeatedly try out multiple different clubs. The measurements that the apparatus collects are highly accurate.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> illustrates angular relationships of the head and shaft of a golf club in two views labeled A and B. Referring first to view A, a golf putter <b>106</b> comprises a head <b>108</b> that is affixed to a neck and an angled shaft element <b>112</b>. Golf clubs and putters are commonly constructed with the shaft affixed to the body of the club at an angle relative to the ground, as viewed from the striking face of the club, known commonly as the &#x201c;angle of lie&#x201d;, or &#x201c;lie angle&#x201d; <b>102</b>, as seen in view A. In the apparatus herein, the angle can be set to between 63 degrees and 80 degrees from the horizontal <b>104</b>, or an angle lesser or greater, limited only by applicable golf sanctioning bodies' regulations. The range of values for lie angle <b>102</b> can accommodate a wide distribution of player stances and putting styles, as well as the variety of construction of the putter to be fitted.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In an embodiment, a virtual display represents and displays an image of the putter <b>106</b> from the viewpoint of the player seeking to have a putter fitted to the player. The displayed position and shape of the putter head <b>108</b> is updated in real time on the display by the fitting system processor to precisely match the configuration being fitted. Though the location of the bend <b>114</b> in the putter neck <b>110</b> can vary widely among different putter styles, and be closer or nearer the ground, towards the heel end <b>116</b> or toe end <b>118</b> of the putter, a pivot point <b>120</b> used in computations within the fitting apparatus <b>12</b> is fixed at an arbitrary point which is convenient mechanically, based on a known position of the center of the neck bend <b>114</b>. Thus the displayed image of the putter neck <b>110</b> must move in unison with the fitting apparatus shaft <b>218</b> and grip <b>214</b> as if it were a real putter in the hands of the player being fitted. Further, a value for the position of the center of the neck bend <b>114</b> for different golf club models may be stored data tables <b>16</b> and retrieved by computer <b>14</b> for use in displaying images of virtual clubheads correctly.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In the embodiment, of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> view A, the pivot axis <b>122</b> terminates at a pivot point <b>120</b> that is offset by 0.666 inches from a center <b>124</b> of the putter <b>106</b> and the lie angle <b>102</b> is 63 degrees. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> view B, the pivot axis terminates at a point that is offset by 0.834 inches from a center of the putter and the lie angle is 70 degrees. For other lie angle values the pivot axis <b>122</b> may terminate at other offset points.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In an embodiment, a three-dimensional model of the putter <b>106</b> is constructed in a Computer Aided Design (CAD) software program. The model is positioned in an assembly containing a model of the fitting apparatus <b>12</b>, such that the lie angle <b>102</b> of the putter <b>106</b> can be changed, and the shaft axis <b>122</b> of the putter is concentric with the shaft and grip of the fitting apparatus, while the head <b>108</b> of the putter <b>106</b> remains horizontal and centered in the field of view laterally. If the pivot axis <b>120</b> of the fitting apparatus <b>12</b> were placed exactly at the center of the bend <b>114</b> of the putter <b>106</b>, the only change visible in the display <b>15</b> as the neck angle changed would be the shape of the neck as it moves through its angular range. If, however, the location or center of the putter neck bend and the location of the fitting machine arm pivot are not coincident, the putter will move nearer or closer to the player as the neck angle changes.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The images displayed on the display <b>15</b> of fitting apparatus <b>12</b> are rendered using the photorealistic rendering module within Solidworks or a similar CAD program. The images are rendered from the perspective of the player with his eye directly above the ball vertically, which is a putting stance that is accepted as correct. A sequence of still graphical images, covering the entire range of lie angles, is rendered at an angular interval of approximately 0.2 degrees, or more or less, as appropriate to depict smooth motion. Images can be rendered from the perspective of a player of average height, or many sequences of images can be generated from the perspective of players of different heights as may be needed for players of different stature. Additionally, a standard head tracking mechanism can be employed to allow any possible player perspective to be rendered.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In an embodiment, the images are transferred to the processor of the fitting apparatus <b>12</b> and displayed in synchronization with the angle of the fitting machine pivoting arm, such that the image of the putter appears exactly as it would if a real putter were positioned on the floor. Additionally, two sets of images, rendered from the perspective of each eye can also be employed with an appropriate display capable of generating stereo images.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">2.0 Golf Club Fitting Apparatus</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is an exploded perspective view of a golf club fitting apparatus. In an embodiment, a generally rectangular, planar base plate <b>202</b> and a generally rectangular, planar top plate <b>208</b> having a hole <b>212</b> form a housing for display <b>15</b> and a circuit board <b>13</b>&#x2032;, which may comprise encoder interface <b>13</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>). A transparent protective sheet <b>204</b> overlays the display <b>15</b> to protect the display from scratches, dirt, or damage. The circuit board <b>13</b>&#x2032; is received in a recess in an underside of top plate <b>208</b>. In this arrangement, images appearing on display <b>15</b> are visible through hole <b>212</b> when a user is looking downward toward the top plate <b>208</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Top plate <b>208</b> comprises a recess <b>210</b> in which a sliding, rotating arm assembly is mounted to enable a person to grasp a simulated golf club and to slide and rotate the shaft of the club until the shaft is in a comfortable position at address of a simulated golf ball. In an embodiment, a grip <b>214</b> is affixed to a shaft <b>218</b>, which comprises a lower end <b>220</b> that is affixed in a generally upright or vertical orientation in a hole <b>222</b> of a first end of an arm <b>224</b>. End <b>220</b> and hole <b>222</b> may be threaded and retained in place by a nut <b>216</b> to facilitate removing and replacing the shaft <b>218</b>. In this arrangement, the grip <b>214</b> and shaft <b>218</b> may be removed from the apparatus <b>12</b> and a different grip and/or shaft having a different length or other characteristics may be mounted on arm <b>224</b>. In an embodiment that is used for fitting putters, for example, the arrangement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> allows using an interchangeable shaft for custom fitting a belly putter or long putter.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">A second end of the arm <b>224</b> is affixed perpendicularly to a top end of a linear guide rail <b>226</b> that forms one element of a sliding linear guide <b>228</b>. In an embodiment, linear guide <b>228</b> allows about 10&#x2033; (25 cm) to 12&#x2033; (30 cm) of upward or downward linear travel of the shaft <b>218</b> in an axial direction; in various embodiments, linear guides of 10&#x2033; to 32&#x2033; may be appropriate.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Thus, in use, pulling up or pushing down on grip <b>214</b> vertically with respect to base plate <b>208</b> causes the grip, shaft <b>218</b>, arm <b>224</b>, and linear guide rail <b>226</b> to slide up or down with respect to linear guide <b>228</b>. A digital linear encoder <b>229</b> is integrated into linear guide <b>228</b> and can generate digital electronic signals representing a relative linear position of the guide along its dimensions of travel. The linear encoder <b>229</b> is electrically coupled to circuit board <b>13</b>&#x2032; using wiring or cables that are omitted for clarity.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">A lower end of the linear guide <b>228</b> comprises a hole <b>230</b> arranged perpendicular to a direction of travel of the linear guide. The linear guide <b>228</b> rotates around an axis of hole <b>230</b> on an axle <b>239</b> that is rotatably mounted in a bearing plate <b>232</b> using mounting hardware <b>238</b>, <b>240</b> that comprises nuts, washers, ball bearings, etc. The bearing plate <b>232</b> is fixed in a case mount <b>242</b> that seats in recess <b>210</b> of housing <b>208</b> and is held in the recess using one or more fasteners such as machine screws, which are omitted for clarity.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The linear guide <b>228</b> may be protected within a housing <b>248</b> having right and left side plates <b>250</b>A, <b>250</b>B, respectively. The side plates <b>250</b>A, <b>250</b>B may have semicircular or beveled lower ends to permit the side plates to rotate through an angle of approximately 90 degrees when affixed to housing <b>248</b> and during rotation with respect to top plate <b>208</b>. The side plates conceal the mechanism to prevent damage to the mechanism, personal injury, entanglement in the apparatus, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Thus, in use, pulling or pushing grip <b>214</b> in a direction approximately perpendicular to linear guide <b>228</b> causes the grip, shaft <b>218</b>, arm <b>224</b>, and linear guide rail <b>226</b> to rotate with respect to axle <b>239</b> and base plate <b>208</b>. An electronic digital angular encoder <b>234</b> is integrated into the lower end of the linear guide <b>228</b> for measuring an angular position of the lower end of the linear guide as the linear guide rotates on axle <b>239</b> and can generate digital electronic signals representing a relative rotational position of the guide or relative angular position of the guide or shaft with respect to a horizontal plane coplanar with the base <b>208</b> or ground surface. The angular encoder <b>234</b> is electrically coupled to circuit board <b>13</b>&#x2032; using wiring or cables that are omitted for clarity. In this disclosure, the terms &#x201c;angular encoder&#x201d; and &#x201c;rotary encoder&#x201d; are equivalent. The angular encoder <b>234</b> may be affixed to linear guide <b>228</b> using a shoulder bolt or other suitable fastener.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The apparatus <b>12</b> may comprise a gas spring <b>236</b> that is mounted to the linear guide <b>228</b> for urging the linear guide into a rest position or home position when no force is exerted on the grip <b>214</b> or shaft <b>218</b>. Gas spring <b>236</b> may also function to dampen linear or rotational movement of the apparatus to prevent damage to its parts that could be caused by a user exerting excessive force on the apparatus. Gas spring <b>236</b> may also provide balance in the apparatus. In an embodiment, gas spring <b>236</b> is manufactured by Industrial Gas Systems, Inc. The gas spring <b>236</b> may be integrated into the linear guide system for compactness.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Additional dampening may be provided by an over-travel limiter or dampener <b>246</b> that is horizontally secured in recess <b>210</b> and to the linear guide <b>228</b> using a rocker arm and tie rod assembly <b>206</b>. In this manner the linear guide will not slam into other parts of the apparatus when the shaft is moved suddenly or released by a user, and deceleration of the apparatus is smoothly controlled. An embodiment is further described below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Detecting that the apparatus has reached a home position can be performed by moving the arm past a fiducial that is optically detected. A signal indicating detection of the fiducial may be provided to computer <b>14</b> for use in software that interprets a position of the apparatus. In an embodiment, gas spring <b>236</b> is omitted and other mechanisms for damping or reaching a home position are used, such as gears, motors, wire springs, coil springs, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a front elevation view of the apparatus of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> approximates a view of a user of the apparatus as a user approaches the apparatus for use. In this arrangement a user may grip the grip <b>214</b> in a golf club address stance with the user's feet positioned adjacent to a front edge <b>209</b> of top plate <b>208</b> looking downward on the top plate. In this position the user may urge the grip <b>214</b> and shaft <b>218</b> upward or downward in the vertical linear direction generally indicated by arrow <b>302</b>, thereby causing the grip <b>214</b>, shaft <b>218</b>, and arm <b>224</b> to move as a unit upward or downward with respect to top plate <b>208</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">From <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> it is apparent that shaft <b>218</b> does not extend entirely to the base <b>208</b> or to an actual clubhead or base mechanism that simulates a clubhead. Instead, a display is in the base <b>208</b> and during fitting a virtual clubhead is displayed in the display using the techniques described further herein. However, the user may grasp the grip <b>214</b> and move the shaft upward or side to side until a comfortable holding position is reached.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a rear elevation view of the apparatus of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. In an embodiment, a rear edge <b>211</b> of top plate <b>208</b> comprises one or more connectors <b>213</b> for coupling signals from the display <b>15</b>, linear encoder <b>229</b>, and angular encoder <b>234</b> to the computer <b>14</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a left side elevation view of the apparatus of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a right side elevation view of the apparatus of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Arrows <b>502</b>, <b>504</b> indicate a direction of angular or rotational motion through which the grip <b>214</b>, shaft <b>218</b>, arm <b>224</b>, and housing <b>248</b> travel when a user urges the grip left or right with respect to base plate <b>208</b> as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Moving the grip in such directions causes the grip <b>214</b>, shaft <b>218</b>, arm <b>224</b>, and housing <b>248</b> to rotate about an axis of axle <b>239</b> as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. During such motion the gas lift <b>236</b> extends or retracts according to the movement of the shaft <b>218</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">A user may simultaneously move grip <b>214</b> and shaft <b>218</b> upward or downward as arrow <b>302</b> indicates. Thus, the apparatus <b>12</b> provides two degrees of freedom that allow a user to rapidly move the apparatus to a comfortable golf swing address position. When the apparatus <b>12</b> is in such a comfortable position, values of the linear encoder and angular encoder may be used to determine a shaft length and lie angle for a golf club that is custom fit to the user's comfortable position.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a top plan view of the apparatus of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> approximates a view of a user looking down on display <b>15</b> and about to grasp grip <b>214</b> to place the grip and shaft <b>218</b> in a comfortable golf swing address position. In such a position, the user can view display <b>15</b> to see an image of a golf club head at address of a golf ball as the grip and shaft are moved to a comfortable position.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref> is a bottom plan view of the apparatus of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> further illustrating a mechanical arrangement of the base plate <b>202</b> in relation to housing <b>248</b>, arm <b>224</b>, shaft <b>218</b> and grip <b>214</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref> is a bottom plan view of an embodiment of the base of the apparatus with base plate <b>202</b> removed. In this embodiment, within housing <b>248</b> the linear guide <b>228</b> is attached to a tie rod <b>206</b>A that is seated within recess <b>210</b> and connected to rocker arm <b>206</b>B, which is secured to a gas spring <b>246</b>B and end-of-travel damper <b>246</b>A. As a result, releasing or suddenly moving the shaft <b>214</b> after rotating the shaft will cause the shaft to slowly return to a home position, urged by gas spring <b>246</b>B yet dampened by damper <b>246</b>A so that the gas spring moves the apparatus to the home position gently and softly stops at the home position. This approach is useful to reduce wear on the encoders, linear guide, and other mechanical elements.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">For purposes of illustrating a clear example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-8</figref> depict an apparatus having certain structural characteristics and interrelationships.

For example, display <b>22</b> shows one or more different putter types such as straight shaft with offset head, belly style, etc. In an embodiment, step <b>912</b> may comprise displaying only one model or step <b>912</b> may be omitted if a particular manufacturer does not offer multiple models. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref> illustrates an example screen display that may be generated at step <b>912</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">In step <b>914</b>, the operator selects a particular club model from among the available models shown in the display.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">In response, in step <b>916</b>, the apparatus may display detailed specifications for the selected club model. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref> illustrates an example screen display that may be generated at step <b>916</b>. In an embodiment, the display of step <b>916</b> includes a button, icon or other GUI widget that identifies an ordering function. By selecting the ordering function, the operator indicates interest in fitting and ordering the corresponding club model.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">In step <b>918</b>, the ordering function is selected. In response, in step <b>920</b> a base image display unit is activated, such as display <b>15</b>, and an image of a golf club head for the selected club model is displayed. In an embodiment, the image of a virtual golf club head is displayed in a display unit in the floor of the apparatus adjacent to the user's feet so that the image of the golf club head is rendered in a position and from a perspective approximately the same as the appearance of a real golf club head if a customer were holding a real golf club.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">In an embodiment, the image is three-dimensional and comprises a virtual golf club head. In various embodiments the image may also display a virtual golf ball, putting surface, fairway surface, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">In an embodiment, the image is a static graphical image that is stored in the apparatus, and a plurality of images are generated in advance and stored in the apparatus at the time that the apparatus is manufactured, as described above in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>. SolidWorks software or an equivalent 3D CAD or modeling program may be used to create the images. For example, a 3D model of a particular type of clubhead is created in SolidWorks, and a macro is prepared that rotates the model through successive angles of rotation about the center of the neck bend <b>114</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>) and captures and stores static graphical images of the appearance of the clubhead at each successive angle. The number of successive angles may vary in different embodiments; for example, one image may be generated for every 2 degrees of rotation of the 3D model. Preparation of an appropriate model in the 3D CAD software requires knowledge of the point of rotation about the center of the neck bend <b>114</b> for the specific model or type of putter or other club that is to be fitted to a user using the apparatus <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">The use of static graphical images enables the use of very high resolution images, if desired; in an alternative embodiment, a three-dimensional display of a virtual clubhead may be rendered based on a stored data model of a clubhead. Images appropriate for a left-handed golfer or right-handed golfer may be retrieved from memory and displayed on display <b>15</b> by computer <b>14</b> in response to data collected in steps <b>906</b>-<b>918</b> or another step.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">In step <b>921</b>, a customer or golfer stands on a base of the fitting apparatus, grips a shaft of a simulated golf club, and slides and/or rotates the shaft to the best position for that customer when in a playing stance or other position in which the customer addresses a ball before swinging the golf club.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">In step <b>922</b>, a rotation value and a linear measurement value are received from a first encoder and a second encoder of the apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">In step <b>924</b>, a length value representing the length of a golf club shaft is created based on the received linear measurement value, and a lie angle value is created based on the received rotation value. In an embodiment, step <b>924</b> involves mapping the received linear measurement value to a length value using a stored data table or spreadsheet, and similarly a lie angle value is determined by mapping or looking up the received rotation value in a data table. A spreadsheet may be used to create the mappings. Alternatively, computer <b>14</b> may apply algorithm transformations to the received values to result in length in lie angle values. In an embodiment, step <b>924</b> involves computing an angle of a golf club shaft to the ground in degrees, e.g., 67 degrees. In an embodiment, step <b>924</b> involves computing a shaft length of a golf club, e.g. 33&#x2033;.In an embodiment, head weight of a custom fitted golf club is determined based upon a stored data table or retrieved from a spreadsheet file.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">In step <b>926</b>, the golf club head image is updated and re-displayed based on any movement of the apparatus as represented in the received rotation value and linear measurement value. Successive images for re-display may be selected by comparing the received rotation value to a mapping stored in a data table that maps encoder values to names of corresponding still image files that represent the appearance of a clubhead when the shaft of a club is rotated according to the received rotation value. Thus, in an embodiment, while the user is sliding or rotating the shaft, one or more different still images of the virtual golf club head are re-displayed in the display <b>15</b>. In an embodiment, the different still images are re-displayed rapidly in &#x201c;flip-book&#x201d; fashion so that the display appears to be animated and the virtual golf club head appears to be moving in coordination with the user's movement of the shaft. As a result, the user receives the illusion of gripping an actual golf club at address to a ball while adopting a stance, grip and position that is most comfortable for that user.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">In step <b>928</b>, the process tests whether the club fit is acceptable to the customer. Step <b>928</b> may involve, for example, determining whether the operator of the apparatus has selected a SELECT FIT button, icon or other identifier shown in display <b>22</b>. If the operator has not made such a selection, then control returns to step <b>921</b>. Using the loop formed by steps <b>921</b>-<b>928</b>, the image is updated and re-displayed in real time based on real-time movement of the golfer or customer.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">In an embodiment, logic in the computer <b>14</b> prompts the user to allow the apparatus <b>12</b> to move to a home position and re-perform step <b>921</b> a plurality of times, and steps <b>922</b>-<b>928</b> are automatically repeated as well. As a result, the computer <b>14</b> collects a plurality of successive measurements of the same individual repeatedly grasping the simulated club in a comfortable position, which has been found to increase the accuracy of fitting. In an embodiment, six (6) measurements are collected, the greatest and lowest values for rotation and linear measurement are discarded, and the remaining four (4) values are averaged to result in final values. In other embodiments, different numbers of values and blending algorithms may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">If the club fit is acceptable, then control transfers to step <b>930</b>, at which the operator provides a signal indicating that the club fit is acceptable. Step <b>930</b> may involve, for example, the operator of the apparatus selecting a SELECT FIT button, icon or other identifier shown in display <b>22</b>. In response, the system updates an order page shown on display <b>22</b> with the shaft length and lie angle value that were created at step <b>924</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10C</figref> illustrates an example screen display that may be generated at step <b>924</b>. In an embodiment, an order summary page <b>1001</b> is displayed on the display <b>22</b> of kiosk <b>20</b> and is filled in by the apparatus in part, and in part by a salesperson or other user as part of placing an order for a club. In an embodiment, the order summary page <b>1001</b> comprises club details <b>1002</b> and an image <b>1004</b> of the club head that the customer is ordering. Order summary page <b>1001</b> comprises a grip selection widget <b>1006</b> that can receive user input specifying a particular grip size.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">Order summary page <b>1001</b> comprises a length value <b>1008</b> and a lie angle value <b>1010</b> that are automatically determined and displayed based upon a position of shaft <b>218</b> of apparatus <b>12</b> and values received from the apparatus. Thus, in an embodiment, length value <b>1008</b> and lie angle value <b>1010</b> have been received from the apparatus <b>12</b> and are automatically filled into the order summary page <b>1001</b> at the time it is displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">In an embodiment, order summary page <b>1001</b> comprises a head weight value <b>1009</b> that displays a default head weight value for the club and that provides an option to customize the head weight value. Thus, in an embodiment the head weight value <b>1009</b> is displayed in a text box or other GUI widget and a user may replace the head weight value with a different value. The default head weight value <b>1009</b> may be obtained from a look-up table or other stored data source that associates head weight values with length values <b>1008</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">In an embodiment, for ordering putters, order summary page <b>1001</b> comprises a plurality of alignment marking options <b>1012</b>. A user or customer may select one of the options <b>1012</b> to specify where an alignment mark should appear on the club. In an embodiment, order summary page <b>1001</b> comprises an alignment color option <b>1014</b> that can receive a user selection of a color for the alignment mark. Typical colors might include black, white, red, yellow, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">In an embodiment, order summary page <b>1001</b> comprises an engraving option <b>1016</b> that can receive user entry of a set of initials or a name to engrave on the club head or club shaft. In an embodiment, order summary page <b>1001</b> comprises an engraving color option <b>1018</b> that can receive a user selection of a color for the engraved initials or engraved name.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">In an embodiment, order summary page <b>1001</b> comprises a head cover color option <b>1020</b> that can receive a user selection of a color of a head cover that the golf club manufacturer will ship with the custom fitted club to protect the head of the club when it is in a customer's golf club bag.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">In step <b>934</b>, order data is created and sent over a network to a manufacturer. For example, a user selects an &#x201c;Add to Cart&#x201d; button <b>1022</b> on a display of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref> and completes a shopping cart page sequence to provide personal information or payment details to complete an order. Step <b>934</b> may comprise creating an XML document containing order data or creating any other convenient form of message or transmission that can contain order data. The order data comprises at least the shaft length value and lie angle value that were created at step <b>924</b> and customer identifying information. Order data also may include shipping information, identifying information for golf club retailer <b>10</b> or kiosk <b>20</b>, club identifying information, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">The order data also may include any of several other parameters for custom fitted golf clubs including head paint color, grip color, initials on club head, head cover color, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">The order data also may include a grip type and user selection of a different grip type can cause a change in the head weight value retrieved from the data table. In an embodiment, the order data comprises static loft at address expressed as either a left or right measurement. Static loft represents the loft of the clubface compared to a horizontal plane of the hosel of the club.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">In an embodiment, the order data also may include a neck offset value, which may be selected from a set of values that are displayed on display <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">In an embodiment, shaft <b>218</b> is interchangeable in the apparatus <b>12</b>, and the apparatus comprises elements to automatically detect interchangeable shafts. For example, each shaft <b>218</b> may have a lower end that is encoded with optical indicia that are detected by an optical detector integrated into hole <b>222</b> or arm <b>224</b>. Alternatively, each shaft <b>218</b> is keyed using holes, indentations, bosses or protrusions that mechanically depress or receive mechanically floating pins in the hole <b>222</b>. In such an alternative, fitting a particular shaft <b>218</b> into hole <b>222</b> causes depressing a particular pattern of pins in the hole <b>222</b> that uniquely identify the shaft length. A signal representing the pin pattern, or optical indicia, is communicated from arm <b>224</b> to computer <b>14</b>, which transforms the signal into a shaft length value for use in the custom fitting process.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a flow diagram of a method of making a golf club. In step <b>1102</b>, a data communication session is established over a network between a golf club fitting apparatus and a data server. For example, in the context of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, computer <b>14</b> establishes a session through network <b>30</b> to data server <b>32</b>. A session may comprise an HTTP request-response dialog, an FTP upload session, etc. The data server is at a golf club manufacturer, contractor, distributor, reseller, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">In step <b>1104</b>, a length value representing a golf club length is received over the network. For example, data server <b>32</b> receives a length value from computer <b>14</b> that was created based on values received from encoder interface <b>13</b>. Data server <b>32</b> may receive the length value in an XML document, HTTP request, or other message format or document format. In step <b>1106</b>, a lie angle value representing a golf club lie angle is received over the network. The lie angle value may be received at data server <b>32</b> in the same XML document or HTTP request that carried the length value.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">In step <b>1108</b>, a golf club is made having a length equal to the received length value and a head lie angle equal to the received lie angle value.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">At step <b>1110</b>, optionally a head weight value is received and used in making the club at step <b>1108</b>. A shaft length value also may be received or retrieved from a stored data table. Alternatively, a shaft length value alone may be received, and an optimal or appropriate head weight value may be retrieved from a stored table that maps shaft length values to head weight values for various golf club models or club types. Thus, the head weight used in manufacture can vary based on shaft length.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">At step <b>1112</b> optionally a static loft value is received and used in making the club at step <b>1108</b>. At step <b>1114</b> optionally a rotation value and linear measurement value are received from encoders of the apparatus and a length value and lie angle value are determined at the data server. Thus, step <b>1114</b> may involve receiving &#x201c;raw&#x201d; encoder position data values from the apparatus and converting the position values into length value and lie angle value. The resulting length value and lie angle value are used in making a golf club at step <b>1108</b>.</p>
