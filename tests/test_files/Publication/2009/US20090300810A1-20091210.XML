<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention pertains to automatic darkening protective filter lens that is capable of changing from a light state to a dark state.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Automatic darkening filters, or ADFs, are often used for applications like welding where protection from intense levels of incident light, such as the glare of a welding arc, is desired. A typical ADF includes electronic control circuitry, powered by a battery, which causes the filter to change from a light (clear or transparent) state when not subjected to the glare of the welding arc to a dark (nearly opaque) state upon exposure to such glare. This enables a welder to perform a welding operation and also perform tasks outside the welding area without removing the protective shield.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Conventional ADFs include layers of liquid crystal material capable of changing from a light state to a dark state under control of a control voltage. A sensor detects the start of a welding arc and generates a corresponding control voltage which, when applied to the filter lens, causes it to change from a light state to a dark state. Because the arc is already switched on when the sensors react, the switching of the ADF has to be very short, e.g., less than a few hundred microseconds. This abrupt or “hard” transition between the light state and the dark state can be uncomfortable to the user, especially under working conditions where many light-to-dark transitions are experienced throughout the course of a typical work day.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The sensors in a conventional ADF may be adversely affected by interference from other light sources, other welding machines, currents, or magnetic fields in the vicinity, which could cause the ADF to enter the dark state in the absence of a welding arc. In certain applications—such as low current tungsten inert gas (TIG) welding—the usable signal from the welding arc is relatively weak. In these cases, the detector may fail to detect the arc, resulting in failure of the ADF to enter the dark state even in the presence of a welding arc.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The invention provides a protective automatic darkening filter (ADF) and an associated tool, such as a welding torch, which ADF and tool are controlled by a corresponding communication unit. The invention helps ensure that the tool is not activated before the ADF has reached its dark state. A communication channel between the communication unit and the ADF may be established using a wired or wireless medium.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In one embodiment, the invention is directed to a system comprising a switchable filter that changes from a light state to a dark state in response to a dark state command message, a power controller that provides power to a tool in response to an activate tool command, and a communication unit that generates the dark state command in response to a tool activation signal, wherein the switchable filter further generates a dark state acknowledge message upon entering the dark state, and wherein the communication unit further generates the activate tool command in response to the dark state acknowledge message.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In another embodiment, the invention is directed to a method that comprises: receiving a tool activation signal; generating a dark state command message for a switchable filter in response to the tool activation signal; receiving a dark state acknowledge message from the switchable filter; and generating an activate tool command in response to the dark state acknowledge message.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In another embodiment, the invention is directed to a method that comprises: receiving a tool activation signal; generating a dark state command message for a switchable filter in response to the tool activation signal; waiting for a dark state wait time to elapse; and generating an activate tool command after the dark state wait time has elapsed.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">As used in this application, the term “automatic darkening filter” (ADF) means a protective device including circuitry and a switchable filter or lens that is designed to protect a user's eyes from excessive glare in an environment such as welding or in other environments where there is the potential for damage to the human eye from excessively bright light. The terms “switchable filter” and “ADF lens” mean a filter that is capable of changing from a light state to a dark state in response to a control signal.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The details of one or more embodiments of the invention are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, objects, and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the description and drawings, and from the claims.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows an example of a welding helmet <b>10</b> that includes a helmet body or shell <b>12</b> and an automatic darkening filter (ADF) <b>14</b>. Specifically, the ADF <b>14</b> includes an auto-darkening filter lens <b>20</b> supported in the helmet shell <b>12</b>. The auto-darkening filter lens <b>20</b> may be mounted in the helmet shell <b>12</b> so that it is directly in front of the wearer's eyes when the helmet is worn by the user. In one embodiment, the switchable lens <b>20</b> is replaceable. The lens <b>20</b> may include a rectangular (or other shaped) frame or housing. Examples of such filters are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,097,451 and 5,825,441, both to Hörnell and Palmer. Examples of helmet shells may be seen, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,185,739, 5,533,206, 5,191,468, 5,140,707, 4,875,235, and 4,853,973. The helmet <b>12</b> also may have clean air supplied to the interior, and thus may include a face seal to separate a breathing zone from the ambient air. An example of such a face seal is shown in U.S. patent application Ser. Nos. 10/987,512, 10/987,641, 10/988,789, 29/217,155, 29/217,153, 29/217,154, 29/217,107,and 29/217,156.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a block diagram of an ADF system that includes an ADF <b>14</b>, a tool <b>50</b>, a power controller <b>30</b>, and a communication unit <b>40</b>. The ADF <b>14</b> includes a switchable filter lens <b>20</b> that is capable of changing from a light state to a dark state. Control of switchable filter lens <b>20</b> is provided by filter control electronics <b>22</b> via connection <b>24</b>. In one embodiment, switchable filter lens <b>20</b> may be a laminate of several different layers including, for example, UV/IR filters, polarizers, and liquid crystal elements. In other embodiments, switchable filter lens <b>20</b> may be constructed using electro chrominance filters. Switchable filter lens <b>20</b> acts as a shutter that darkens in response to a control signal to shade the lens and thereby protect the user's eyes from harmful glare resulting from operation of tool <b>50</b>, such as the glare of a welding arc produced from operation of a welding torch. Examples of suitable switchable filters are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,097,451 and 5,825,441, and in copending and commonly assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/076,081 to Magnusson et al., filed Mar. 9, 2005.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Tool <b>50</b> may include, for example, a welding torch or other type of machine tool or power tool. Tool <b>50</b> may be any kind of power or machine tool of the types used in many different industries—for example, carpentry tools, plumbing tools, or machine tools of other trades—and it shall be understood that the invention is not limited in this respect. For purposes of illustration, however, the invention is described as it applies to tools used in the welding industry, such as welding torches. Power controller <b>30</b> contains the necessary power control electronics necessary to provide energy to tool <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The invention provides a protocol between the ADF <b>14</b> and a communication unit <b>40</b> to ensure that tool <b>50</b> is not activated until the ADF <b>14</b> has entered the dark state. A communication channel <b>32</b>, which may be either unidirectional or bidirectional, provides for communication between the ADF <b>14</b> and the communication unit <b>40</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows the communication channel <b>32</b> as a wireless communication channel, although the communication channel <b>32</b> may also be provided via a wired connection. Wireless communication may be provided using any of the many known wireless communication methods, such as infra-red communication, radio frequency (RF) communication, or acoustical communication, or by any suitable later-developed technology. Command lines <b>42</b>, <b>44</b>, and <b>46</b> allow communication between communication unit <b>40</b>, power controller <b>30</b>, and tool <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Messages that are transmitted between communication unit <b>40</b> and the ADF <b>14</b> are used to control the transition of lens <b>20</b> from the light state to the dark state and vice versa. These messages also control activation of tool <b>50</b>. In this way, the system ensures that lens <b>20</b> is in the dark state before it allows activation of tool <b>50</b>. In a welding environment, for example, in which tool <b>50</b> would be a welding torch, communication unit <b>40</b> ensures that the lens <b>20</b> is in the dark state before power controller <b>30</b> is allowed to ignite the welding arc. Although communication unit <b>40</b> is shown as a separate component in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the functionality of the communication unit also may be located within tool <b>50</b>, between a cable connecting tool <b>50</b> with power controller <b>30</b>, within power controller <b>30</b>, or other suitable position depending upon the particular application and environment in which the system is to be used.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In addition to state change commands from communication unit <b>40</b> and state acknowledges from ADF <b>14</b>, the messages transmitted between the ADF <b>14</b> and the tool controller <b>60</b> through the communication channel <b>32</b> may also include other information. For example, the system may ensure that each ADF is associated with one and only one tool via unique identity codes embedded within the messages transmitted in the communication channel <b>32</b>. To this end, each ADF <b>20</b> may be uniquely associated with one tool <b>50</b> via at least one unique identity code transmitted in the dark state command message. A unique association between ADF <b>20</b> and tool <b>50</b> and/or communication unit <b>40</b> may help ensure that interference from other sources of light, currents, or magnetic fields will not effect the operation of the ADF, causing it to darken or lighten inappropriately.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The tool <b>50</b> can include at least one switch <b>52</b> through which a user controls the start and stop of tool <b>50</b>. In a welding environment, for example, a welder controls the start and stop of the welding arc by pressing or releasing one or more switch(es) located on the welding torch. Switch <b>52</b> may include, for example, push buttons, a trigger, other user actuated switch, or some combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Actuation of switch <b>52</b>, either activating or deactivating (e.g., pressing or releasing) produces a resulting tool activation signal. As used in this description, the term “tool activation signal” refers to any actuation of switch <b>52</b>, whether to activate the tool, deactivate the tool, or adjust the amount of power applied (e.g., to adjust the speed, torque, or intensity of the tool) of the tool.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The tool activation signals resulting from actuation of switches <b>52</b> are received by communication unit <b>40</b> via connection <b>46</b>. In response to the tool activation signals, the communication unit <b>40</b> may communicate with the ADF <b>14</b> via communication channel <b>32</b> to ensure that the ADF lens is changed to the proper state and then allow power controller <b>30</b> to act accordingly. In this way, the ADF system ensures that tool <b>50</b> is not activated before ADF <b>20</b> has entered its dark state and that the user's eyes will not go unprotected.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The system may also result in improved reliability in certain situations. For example, each ADF may be associated with a particular tool controller via unique identity codes embedded in the messages transmitted via communication channel <b>32</b>. This configuration ensures that other welding machines in the neighborhood cannot influence the operation of a particular ADF. Interference from other light sources, currents, or magnetic fields will not affect the ADF operation. In addition, detection of low current TIG welding can be more reliable when the system utilizes a command message rather than a weak photodiode signal to detect the start of a welding arc.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref> are flowcharts illustrating unidirectional control of an ADF. These charts are described with the identifying numerals in the figures for the process steps being presented in parentheses. The identifying numerals used in the text that are not in parenthesis refer to structural parts shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref> show both the process carried out by communication unit <b>40</b> for controlling the transition from the light state to the dark state (<b>100</b>) and the process carried out by communication unit <b>40</b> for controlling the transition from the dark state to the light state (<b>120</b>). Control of the transition from the light state to the dark state (<b>100</b>) begins when communication unit <b>40</b> receives a tool activation signal from tool <b>50</b> (<b>102</b>). The tool activation signal may be user generated by, for example, actuation of one of switches <b>52</b> located on tool <b>50</b>. In response to the tool activation signal, communication unit <b>40</b> generates a dark state command message (<b>104</b>). The dark state command message may include, for example, a command instructing the ADF to enter the dark state as well as unique identity code(s) identifying the communication unit <b>40</b> and the associated ADF <b>20</b> to which the dark state command is directed.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">After generating the dark state command message, communication unit <b>40</b> waits a predetermined length of time sufficient to allow the ADF lens <b>20</b> to enter the dark state (the dark state wait time) (<b>106</b>). The dark state wait time may be less than <b>1</b> second, and further may be anywhere between 1 millisecond and 900 milliseconds, for example. After the dark state wait time has elapsed, communication unit <b>40</b> transmits an activate tool command to power controller <b>30</b> (<b>108</b>). In one embodiment, communication unit <b>40</b> may repeat the dark state command message one or more times during the dark state wait time. If the first dark state command message was not received correctly, the lens <b>20</b> will have another chance to properly receive and respond to the command when the dark state command message is retransmitted. Each retransmission during the wait will increase the probability for a successful message receipt.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Transition control from the dark state to the light state (<b>120</b>) begins when communication unit <b>40</b> receives a tool deactivation signal from tool <b>50</b> (<b>122</b>). This tool deactivation signal may be user generated by, for example, actuation (pressing a pushbutton, releasing a pushbutton or trigger, etc.) of one of switches <b>52</b> located on tool <b>50</b>. In response to the tool deactivation signal, communication unit <b>40</b> transmits a deactivate tool command to power controller <b>30</b> (<b>124</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">After transmitting the deactivate tool command, communication unit <b>40</b> waits a predetermined length of time sufficient to allow power controller <b>30</b> to deactivate tool <b>50</b> (the deactivate tool wait time) (<b>126</b>). The deactivate tool wait time typically is less than <b>1</b> second, and may be anywhere between 1 millisecond and 900 milliseconds, for example. After the deactivate tool wait time has elapsed, communication unit <b>40</b> generates and transmits a light state command message to the ADF <b>14</b> (<b>128</b>). Again, the light state command message may include a command instructing the ADF to enter the light state as well as a unique identity code(s) identifying the communication unit and the associated lens <b>20</b> to which the light state command is directed. The light state command causes the ADF lens <b>20</b> to transition from the dark state to the light state.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref> are flowcharts illustrating bidirectional control of an ADF lens as it transitions from the light state to the dark state. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> shows a process (<b>150</b>) followed by communication unit <b>40</b> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> shows a process (<b>160</b>) followed by ADF <b>20</b> during a bidirectional handshaking protocol. In response to receipt of a tool activation signal (<b>152</b>), the communication unit <b>40</b> generates and transmits a dark state command message via communication channel <b>32</b> (<b>154</b>). Communication unit <b>40</b> waits to receive a dark state acknowledge message (<b>156</b>) from the ADF <b>14</b> via communication channel <b>32</b>, indicating that the ADF lens <b>20</b> has completed the transition from the light state to the dark state. In response to the dark state acknowledge message from the ADF <b>14</b>, the communication unit <b>40</b> transmits an activate tool command to power controller <b>30</b>, thus causing power to be applied to tool <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">On the ADF <b>14</b> side of the protocol (<b>160</b>), upon receipt of the dark state command message (<b>162</b>), the filter controller <b>22</b> applies a corresponding control voltage to switchable filter <b>26</b>, causing it to enter the dark state (<b>164</b>). Once the lens <b>20</b> completes its transition to the dark state, the lens <b>20</b> transmits the dark state acknowledge message via communication channel <b>32</b> (<b>166</b>). As described above, the dark state command message and the dark state acknowledge message may include unique identity code(s) uniquely associating lens <b>20</b> and communication unit <b>40</b> as well as the dark state command and dark state acknowledge.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref> are flowcharts illustrating bidirectional control of the transition of an ADF <b>14</b> from the dark state to the light state. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> shows a process (<b>170</b>) followed by communication unit <b>40</b> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> shows a process (<b>180</b>) followed by ADF <b>14</b> during a bidirectional handshaking protocol. In response to receipt of a tool deactivation signal (<b>172</b>), communication unit <b>40</b> generates a deactivate tool command to power controller <b>30</b> (<b>174</b>). Communication unit <b>40</b> then waits until tool <b>50</b> has been deactivated (<b>176</b>) indicating that power has been removed from tool <b>50</b>. When the tool has been deactivated (<b>176</b>), communication unit <b>40</b> generates and transmits a light state command message via communication channel <b>32</b> (<b>178</b>). On the ADF <b>14</b> side of the protocol (<b>180</b>), upon receipt of the light state command message (<b>182</b>) filter controller <b>22</b> applies an appropriate control voltage to switchable filter <b>26</b>, causing it to transition to the light state (<b>184</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In this manner, ADF <b>14</b> and communication unit <b>40</b> cooperate to ensure that tool <b>50</b> is not activated before the ADF lens <b>20</b> has entered the dark state. Because the ADF and the communication may be uniquely associated with one another via unique identity codes, the invention may help ensure that the operation of the ADF is not influenced by other tools in the vicinity, or by interference from other sources of light, currents, or magnetic fields.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The ADF system described herein may result in improved reliability and relaxed requirements on the switching time of the ADF <b>14</b>. For example, the ADF lens <b>20</b> may enter the dark state more slowly. Because the tool is not activated until a dark state is achieved, activation of the tool may be delayed for an arbitrary length of time (generally some number of milliseconds, such as anywhere between 1 millisecond and 900 milliseconds) allowing enough time for the lens to go completely dark. This means that a “soft” change from light to dark state may be utilized. A smooth transition from light to dark state is more comfortable for the user's eyes than an abrupt change. Also, slower technologies, such as electro chrominance technology, may be used for the switchable filter. Advantages offered by electro chrominance technology may include a “lighter” light state, the potential for better optical characteristics, and lower cost.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The invention may also help to ensure that the ADF is not adversely affected by interference from other sources of light, other welding machines in the vicinity, currents, or magnetic fields that could cause the ADF to enter the dark state even in the absence of a welding arc. Further, the transition to the dark state does not rely on sensing of a welding arc or other source of incident light from which the user is to be protected. Thus, the danger of failing to enter the dark state in those applications where the welding arc signal is weak is reduced or eliminated. Thus, the invention helps to ensure that the ADF provides proper protection to a user in a wide variety of situations and environments.</p>

<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Various embodiments of the invention have been described. For example, a system comprising an ADF and associated tool have been described ensure that the tool is not activated before the ADF has reached its dark state. Nevertheless, various modifications may be made to the system described herein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. For example, although primarily described in the context of welding, the invention may have broad application for a wide variety of other systems or fields.
